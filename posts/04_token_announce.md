Hello!

We are DAO, which develops the Hyperloot protocol. The task of this protocol is to unite the plenty of game worlds and to make trading between the games available and convenient.

The protocol solves the task of private property; it makes the game objects unalienable and provides their free transferring.

##So what is HLT token, and why do developers need it?##

It is a cryptocurrency token which is based on the most widespread and stable blockchain Ethereum ERC20 and solves many usual tasks.

The main task of the protocol is to make the game objects, assets, accounts and other data transferrable.

Yes, in order that any gamer could send to other gamer the objects or data.

Yes, it is possible to store them safely, sell and buy, but all this becomes possible as soon as the free transfer gets available and the users will make free use of their property like in reality.

HLT token is the blood of the project, it helps to access the work and game objects, as well as allows the trading deals. Protocol development is paid by it, it is used for different fees payment, remuneration for challenges and competitions and in general all the mundane activities are performed with it help.

##Why do the protocol need token?##

Token issue may be different, but the most projects hold ICO’s in order to sell tokens to new holders. We do not want to follow this model and do mining instead of ICO like Bitcoin had. We are against the ICO model because of the overextended capitalization of the projects which were not realized yet. We are against the ICO model because of the inevitable desire of investors to own bigger token portfolio than all communities. We organize DAO and make free mining to provide all users with equal rights.

Hyperloot does not give tokens to a team, does not freeze funds and does not allocate funds for development. When the smart contract is launched, the amount of the tokens issued is 0, all have equal rights and opportunities.

##How to get tokens?##

Sure, you can mine them — to do that you should have nodes.

Also follow our updates, in the nearest future our token will be available for buying and selling at the centralized exchanges. The most interesting way is to work in DAO with us.

Join the team, choose the tasks, complete them and get remuneration in tokens. Our project is available to join for and any developed may make his/her contribution to it or even improve the project’s development. Here is our GitHub.

Perhaps you are not a developer, newer mind. Join our community, our group in Discord or Telegram, participate in competitions, help the project and get HTL tokens for that or — the opportunity to become a developer.
